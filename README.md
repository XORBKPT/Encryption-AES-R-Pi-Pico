How It Works
Setup:
The Pico, running MicroPython, connects to the PC via USB and appears as a virtual COM port.
When the script runs (on boot), it communicates over this serial interface.
User Interaction:
The terminal displays "Pico Message Gadget."
The user enters a message, a 32-character hex key (16 bytes), and a 32-character hex IV (16 bytes, adjusted from the query’s 16 characters for AES-CBC compatibility).
Encryption:
The message is encoded to bytes and padded using PKCS5/PKCS7 padding.
AES-CBC encryption is performed using the ucryptolib module with the provided key and IV.
Output Formatting:
The ciphertext is converted to an uppercase hex string.
It’s split into groups of 5 characters, with 5 groups per line, numbered on the left.
Every 10 lines form a block, separated by 3 blank lines (e.g., lines 1-10, blank lines, 11-20, etc.).
Example output for a 16-byte ciphertext (32 hex chars):
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
1 01234 56789 ABCDE F0123 45678
2 9ABCD EF012
Security:
The key and IV are stored only in the Pico’s RAM during execution.
When the terminal closes and the Pico is disconnected or powered off, RAM is cleared naturally.
User Action:
The user can copy the output (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+C in PuTTY) and paste it into a text file.
Compiling and Deploying to a .uf2 File
To make this student-friendly and draggable as a .uf2 file, follow these steps:

Install MicroPython on the Pico:
Download the latest MicroPython .uf2 firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico from micropython.org.
Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico, connect it to the PC via USB, and release the button. It appears as a mass storage device (RPI-RP2).
Drag the .uf2 file onto the Pico. It will install MicroPython and reboot.
Upload the Script as main.py:
Save the script above as main.py on your PC.
Use a tool like Thonny (recommended for students):
Install Thonny from thonny.org.
Connect the Pico via USB (no BOOTSEL needed after MicroPython is installed).
In Thonny, go to File > Save as, select "Raspberry Pi Pico," and name it main.py.
Click OK to upload.
Alternatively, use the Pico’s mass storage mode:
Put the Pico into BOOTSEL mode again.
Copy main.py to the Pico’s filesystem (it appears as a drive).
Disconnect and reconnect the Pico to reboot.
Running the Script:
After uploading main.py, the Pico runs it automatically on boot.
Open a terminal program on the PC (e.g., PuTTY):
Find the COM port assigned to the Pico in Device Manager (e.g., COM3).
Connect with settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity.
The terminal will display "Pico Message Gadget" and prompt for input.
Single .uf2 Option (Advanced):
Embedding the script into a custom .uf2 requires building MicroPython firmware with the script frozen into it, using tools like mpy-cross and the MicroPython source code. This is complex and beyond basic student needs. The above method (standard .uf2 + main.py) is simpler and meets the "drag and drop" goal by leveraging the Pico’s filesystem.
Notes for Students
Terminal Use: Use Ctrl+Shift+C to copy and Ctrl+Shift+V to paste in terminals like PuTTY.
Safety: Disconnect the Pico after use to ensure RAM clears.
Learning: Experiment with different messages to see how the ciphertext changes, but keep the key and IV at 32 hex characters each.
